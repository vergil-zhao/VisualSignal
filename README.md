# Visual Signal

![Demo](https://github.com/vergilchoi/VisualSignal/raw/master/demo.gif)

This app uses ARKit on iOS to display WiFi strength by adding a colored sphere to the scene.

This idea is from a video made by a google engineer (they said). I actually don't who he/she is. If you know that, tell me please.


## How to use

Push the green download button, then just run it in Xcode
