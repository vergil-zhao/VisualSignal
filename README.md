# Visual Signal

![Demo](https://github.com/vergilchoi/VisualSignal/raw/master/demo.gif)

This app uses ARKit on iOS to display WiFi strength by adding a colored sphere to the scene.
Please note that the app using a private API to access WiFi signal strength, so it will not be approved on AppStore.

This idea is from a video made by a google engineer [Ken Kawamoto](https://www.facebook.com/ken.kawamoto.167).

[AR Sensor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ken.arsensor&rdid=com.ken.arsensor) is the Android app made by him on Google Play
